Example: run flow locally

Start Redis: docker run -d --name redis -p 6379:6379 redis:7-alpine

Start Kafka/Zookeeper: docker compose up -d (see docker-compose.yml)

Train model: python trainer.py (creates model.joblib)

Start consumer: python scoring_consumer.py

Start producer: python producer.py


Notes & next steps (production considerations)

Schema: switch to Avro/Schema Registry to validate messages.

Security: use TLS + SASL for Kafka, ACLs, and encryption at rest.

Scaling: run multiple consumer instances in same group (partition your transactions topic appropriately).

Stateful processing: consider Kafka Streams (Java) or ksqlDB for windowed aggregations; for Python, consider Faust-like frameworks or use Redis / RocksDB for feature state.

Feature store: move to an actual feature store or DB (Redis is fine for prototyping).

Model management: use model registry, versioning (MLflow, S3), and online model updates with canary testing.

Latency: for low-latency (ms) scoring, keep features in-memory or cache; for batched/periodic scoring use batch jobs.

Explainability & logging: log decision reasons, feature values, and retain for audits.

Alerting pipeline: alerts topic → alert service (email/SMS/ops) → manual review UI.
